# Convolutional Neural Networks

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmpDIaiMIeA) is a good explanation of some of the concepts from this topic.

A **Convolutional Layer** is a layer where units are only connected to a few of the nearest neighbours in the input layer.

A **Convolutional Neural Network** (or *convnet*) is a neural network that has convolutional layers.

< TODO Weights are *shared* across all the pixels in a convnet ? >
