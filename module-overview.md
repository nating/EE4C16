# Notes on the 4C16 Module - Machine Learning

The 4C16 Module is an introduction to Machine Learning especially on Deep Neural Nets.

## Introduction to the Module

Machine learning is a field of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

Machine Learning is part of the field of artificial intelligence.

Deep Learning or *Artificial Neural Networks* is particular type of Machine Learning.

<TODO What is Deep Learning?>

Machine Learning is split up into three main fields:

* **Supervised Learning** involves inferring a function from labelled training data.
* **Unsupervised Learning** involves drawing inferences from datasets consisting of input data without labeled responses, such as finding hidden patterns or groupings of data.
* **Reinforcement Learning** involves agents interacting with their environment in such a way to get the maximum reward.

Neural Networks are the only machine learning technique whose performance scales efficiently with the training data size.
